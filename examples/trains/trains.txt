I like trains!
==============

This application handle a fleet of trains circling through Paris.
This application model is the following

A train has color, speed and an initial position.
A Lane element is either a Rail or a Station.
A Lane has a starting Station followed by any number of Lane element.

Each Station has a maximum capacity and each Rail as a length.

Before leaving a station, a train has to check if all along its journey, 
it will stay alone on any rail it circulates on and if there will be enough 
room for it at the next Station.
