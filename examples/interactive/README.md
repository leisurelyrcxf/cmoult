#Chose your own policy update!

In this exemple, we have a small server, uploading pictures to a
client accross the net (perfect for serving pictures of cats!). We
want to update it so that it adds the name of the picture on it,
without disrupting current downloads.

And YOU chose the strategy to use! Should the manager be added when
starting the application or later? Should we use safe redefinition or
thread rebooting? The choice is yours!

Run interactive.sh and see the application run!
