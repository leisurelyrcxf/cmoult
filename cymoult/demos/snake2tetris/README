./snake to launch snake

DEBUG : ./snake tetris to launch tetris without update

Ideas :
* Change variables : game name & author in Board.
* Update only 2 or 3 functions to go from snake to tetris
* Get some "one use functions" to execute to change state of program before changing functions in the program. (see "Cheating" function to move down snake pattern in functions.c)
